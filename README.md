# A repository to try out SKOS-vocabulary maintenance with Excel and GitHub

This repository was created from the template [voc4cat-template](https://github.com/nfdi4cat/voc4cat-template).

It uses the [voc4cat-tool](https://github.com/nfdi4cat/voc4cat-tool) and GitHub features like gh-actions, pull requests etc. to reduce the maintenance workload for contributors and editors.
The template is maintained as part of the [NFDI4Cat](http://www.nfdi4cat.org) initiative.

## How to start?

### Trying out the workflow

To just try out the workflow just go to [voc4cat-playground](https://github.com/nfdi4cat/voc4cat-playground) which is a "deployment" of this repository.

All vocabularies based on this template have the same standard contribution process of

- get and update the vocabulary file (xlsx),
- submit a pull request with the updated file,
- collaborate on the pull request with editors or other github users,
- approval and merge of the pull request

and finally land in the folder `vocabularies` as SKOS-vocabulary files in turtle-format.

In addition, HTML-documentation is created automatically and published on github-pages.

- The general url is `https://{gh-org-name}.github.io/{repository-name}/{vocabulary-name}/`
- Here the vocabulary `vocab_example` is documented at [https://nfdi4cat.github.io/voc4cat-playground/vocab_example/](https://nfdi4cat.github.io/voc4cat-playground/vocab_example/)
 
### Creating vocabularies for catalysis or catalytic reaction engineering

Please strongly consider contributing to [voc4cat](https://github.com/nfdi4cat/voc4cat) instead of creating your own.

## Contributing to vocabularies

To contribute new concepts or collections or change existing ones, you may either submit your contributions as Excel-file or (as an expert) as new/changed turtle file.

Here are the steps, for submitting updates in Excel including the git commands.

- Get the Excel-vocabulary file
  - For an existing vocabulary, the latest version of the vocabulary is always available via github-pages.
    - The general url is `https://{gh-org-name}.github.io/{repository-name}/{vocabulary-name}.xlsx`
    - For example here in nfdi4cat/voc4cat-playground the vocabulary `vocab_example` can be downloaded from [https://nfdi4cat.github.io/voc4cat-playground/vocab_example.xlsx](https://nfdi4cat.github.io/voc4cat-playground/vocab_example.xlsx)
  - For setting up a new vocabulary, use the xlsx-file from the templates-folder.
- Make changes to the Excel file
- Add the Excel file to your clone of the repository into the folder `inbox-excel-vocabs`
  - The name of the Excel-file must match the vocabulary that you want to update (e.g. myvoc.xlsx to update a vocabulary named "myvoc").
  - New vocabularies will be named like the Excel-file (minus the .xlsx-extension).
- Create a pull request with the updated Excel-file on github.
  - Please describe your changes and the motivation for the changes in the pull request note or link to an issue with this information. This will help reviewers to understand the proposed change and decide about it.
- Your pull request will be processed automatically by a CI/CD pipeline that typically runs less than a minute.
- Review the artifacts/logs generated by the CI pipeline.
- If all is good your contribution will be either
  - directly merged by the maintainers
  - or a discussion will be started about what else is needed
  - or why the proposed change may not fit.
- If you need to fix something just update the pull request branch. This will trigger the pipeline to run again.

Finally, when the proposed merge request is accepted, your changes will be integrated in the vocabularies in the folder `vocabularies`.

See [inbox-excel-vocabs/README.md](inbox-excel-vocabs/README.md) for a minimal example how to test the submission process.

## How to suggest improvements to the tooling & template?

To discuss about the workflow for maintaining SKOS vocabularies based on this template, create an [voc4cat-template issue](https://github.com/nfdi4cat/voc4cat-template/issues).

To discuss about the tool that converts Excel to SKOS in gh-actions of this template, create an [voc4cat-tool issue](https://github.com/nfdi4cat/voc4cat-tool/issues).
